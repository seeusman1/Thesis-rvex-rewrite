This manual intends to document the \rvex{} reconfigurable VLIW processor. It is
intended for software developers using the processor and hardware developers who
are only interested in instantiating the processor in their system. It does not
aim to document the internal workings of the processor; the comments in the
source code are a better source of documentation for this. It also does not
document the design choices that were made in the construction of the core; for
this, readers are referred to \cite{vanstraten2016}.

The next chapter gives a top-level overview of the processor. The third chapter
documents the instruction set architecture (ISA) in detail. The fourth chapter
lists all the control registers of the processor. The fifth chapter handles the
trap and interrupt system of the processor. The sixth handles reconfiguration,
the component of the \rvex{} that makes it special. The seventh documents how
the core may be debugged using a computer. The final two chapters are intended
for the hardware developers only, documenting the design-time configuration
options of the core and how it may be instantiated.
