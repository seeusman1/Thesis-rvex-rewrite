This section describes how the reconfigurability of the \rvex{} processor is
achieved. It is divided into two parts. The first part describes the
reconfiguration controller, which is in charge of decoding reconfiguration
requests and synchronizing contexts before committing the new configuration. The
second part describes the reconfigurable interconnect.
