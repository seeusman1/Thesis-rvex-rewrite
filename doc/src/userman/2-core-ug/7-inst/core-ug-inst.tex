\label{sec:core-ug-inst}

This section describes how the core should be instantiated, what the function of
all the external signals are, and how the core may be design-time configured. It
is intended for HDL designers who wish to incorporate the bare-metal core into
their design. \todo{Refer to some place that designers can turn to if they want
to instantiate higher-level \rvex{} core blocks, such as the cached core.}
