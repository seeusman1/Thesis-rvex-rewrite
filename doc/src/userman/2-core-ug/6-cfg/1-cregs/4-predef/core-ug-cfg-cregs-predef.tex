\subsubsection{LAC predefined constants}
\label{sec:core-ug-cfg-cregs-predef}

The following predefined constants are available. These are hardcoded into the
Python scripts.

\begin{itemize}

\item In context control register code only: \code{natural ctxt}. Represents the
context to which the current register belongs.

\item \code{cfgvect CFG} maps to the \code{CFG} generic.

\item \code{bitvec65 RVEX_CORE_TAG} maps to the core version tag, to be stored
in \creg{CTAG}.

\item \code{natural BRANCH_OFFS_SHIFT} maps to the package constant of the same
name, representing the way in which the branch offset field of instructions is
encoded.

\item \code{natural S_*} and \code{natural L_*} map to the pipeline stage and
latency definitions defined in \code{core_pipeline_pkg.vhd}.

\end{itemize}
