\chapter{\rvex{} core internals}
\label{sec:core-int}

This chapter documents how the \rvex{} processor core works internally. Refer to
Chapter~\ref{sec:core-ug} instead if you are only interested in using the core
as is.

The \hyperref[sec:core-int-overview]{first section} of this chapter gives an 
architectural overview of the core, lists the VHDL files that represent the 
core and deals with code style. The \hyperref[sec:core-int-datapath]{second} and 
\hyperref[sec:core-int-flow]{third} sections together describe how instructions 
are executed; the former documents the datapath (tentatively, the lifespan of an 
instruction) while the latter documents how the next instruction is chosen. The 
\hyperref[sec:core-int-reconf]{fourth section} deals with the reconfiguration 
system of the core, and what the interconnect between the lane groups and the 
contexts looks like. Finally, the \hyperref[sec:core-int-debug]{fifth section} 
documents the external debug and trace interfaces.
