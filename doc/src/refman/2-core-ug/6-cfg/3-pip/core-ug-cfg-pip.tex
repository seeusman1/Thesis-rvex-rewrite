\subsection{Pipeline}
\label{sec:core-ug-cfg-pip}

The pipeline configuration consists of a single key-value file in the
\code{config/pipeline} directory of the \rvex{} repository. The configuration
describes how the \rvex{} pipeline is organized by specifying the first stage
and latencies of a multitude of configurable blocks, such as register read and
writeback, branch unit determination, PC+1 computation, etc. The file is
self-documenting by means of its comments.
