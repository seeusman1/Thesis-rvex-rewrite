\section{Instruction set architecture}
\label{sec:core-ug-isa}

The instruction set architecture (ISA) of the \rvex{} processor is primarily 
based on VEX, an example VLIW architecture used in \cite{fisher2005} to explain 
VLIW concepts. A compiler was developed for this architecture by HP, which is 
available as a free download for noncommercial use \cite{hpvex}. In addition, some 
enhancements were made to the instruction set to be compatible with the Lx 
architecture, introduced in \cite{faraboschi2000}. Lx was designed by HP and 
STMicroelectronics for use in SoC (system-on-chip) designs, among which is the 
ST200 family of processors. This architecture comes with an Open64-based 
compiler and Linux port, available for download under the GNU GPL \cite{st200}. 
These tools together provide the basis for the toolchain used for the \rvex{}. 
The instruction encoding for this version of the \rvex{} processor is based on 
that of the previous major version of the \rvex{} \cite{seedorf2010}.

Instead of noting the differences between these architectures, this section 
functions as a reference for the \rvex{} processor ISA in its current state, to 
save the reader from cross-referencing.
