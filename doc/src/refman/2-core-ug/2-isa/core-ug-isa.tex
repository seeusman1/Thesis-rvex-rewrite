\section{Instruction set architecture}
\label{sec:core-ug-isa}

The instruction set architecture (ISA) of the \rvex{} processor is based on the 
HP VEX ISA \todo{Insert reference to HP VEX ISA} and the ST200 processor family 
by STMicroelectronics \todo{Insert reference to information about ST200 family}. 
More specifically, the ISA is mostly copied from the previous version of the 
\rvex processor \todo{Insert reference to Ro\"el's thesis if applicable (I never 
read it...)}. Instead of noting the differences between these architectures, 
this section functions as a reference for the \rvex{} processor ISA in its 
current state, to save the reader from cross-referencing.
