\subsection{Memory}
\label{sec:core-ug-isa-memory}

Each lane group of the \rvex{} processor currently has exactly one memory unit.
The configurability of this may be extended in the future, as memory operations
commonly end up being the critical path when extracting instruction-level
parallelism. However, doing so would require significant modifications to the
\rvex{} core and the reconfigurable cache.

The \rvex{} processor is big endian. This means that when accessing a 32-bit or 
16-bit word, the most significant byte will reside in the lowest address. This
is the opposite of what you may be used to coming from x86.

The \rvex{} processor is capable of reading and writing 32-bit, 16-bit and 8-bit
words. Seperate read instructions exist for reading 16-bit and 8-bit words in
signed or unsigned mode. All $n$-bit accesses must be $n$-bit aligned. If an
access is improperly aligned, a \code{MISALIGNED_ACCESS} trap will be caused.

Note that a 1 kiB block must be defined at design time which the \rvex{}
processor cannot access at all, because it is remapped to the control register
file internally. Refer to Section~\ref{sec:core-ug-isa-regs-creg} for more
information.
