\section{Control registers}
\label{sec:core-ug-creg}

The \rvex{} processor has two control register files. These are the global 
control register file (\code{gbreg}) and the context control register file 
(\code{cxreg}).

The \code{gbreg} file contains mostly status information, such as a general 
purpose cycle counter, the current configuration vector and design-time 
configuration information. While the debug bus has read/write access to 
\code{gbreg}, the core can only read from it.

For more information, refer to Section~\ref{sec:core-ug-isa-regs-creg}.

\subsection{Global control registers}
\label{sec:core-ug-creg-gb}

The following table lists the global control registers of the \rvex{} processor. 
The offsets listed are with respect to the control register base address. If you 
are viewing this manual digitally, you can click the register mnemonics on the 
right to jump to their documentation.

\subsection{Context control registers}
\label{sec:core-ug-creg-cx}

The following table lists the context control registers of the \rvex{} 
processor. The offsets listed are with respect to the control register base 
address. If you are viewing this manual digitally, you can click the register 
mnemonics on the right to jump to their documentation.
