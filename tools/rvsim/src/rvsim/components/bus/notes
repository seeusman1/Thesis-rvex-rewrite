address:    The address to read from or write to.
writeMask:  If zero, this is a read. If nonzero, the 4 LSB specify the byte mask.
flags:      Bit 0: if set, this is a burst access. The bus will remain claimed
              by this master during the response cycle, so the 
            Bit 1: Lock. The 
data:       Data buffer. Must be at least <burstCount> entries large. For
              writes, this must be filled by the caller. For reads, the callee
              will fill it.
fault:      Fault flag for each
