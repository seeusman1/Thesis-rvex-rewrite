Before changing any code in the simulator, you must know how to use the special
types like bitvec<n>_t:

natural_t:
  Stores a value from 0 to 0x7FFFFFFF, like the VHDL natural type. All other
  values are illegal.

boolean_t:
  Stores a boolean. Zero represents false, one represents true. Thus, it can
  be used as a C condition without masking. All values other than 0 and 1 are
  illegal.

bit_t:
  Stores a single bit in its LSB. High order bits are DON'T CARE; they MUST be
  masked when the don't care bits make a difference.

bitvec<n>_t and unsigned<n>_t:
  Stores n bits in the LSBs. High order bits are DON'T CARE; they MUST be masked
  when the don't care bits make a difference. bitvec<n>_t and unsigned<n>_t are
  completely equivalent in C; normally you would only use bitvec<n>_t. The
  unsigned<n>_t typedefs only exists because they *are* different in the
  language-agnostic configuration files and VHDL.
