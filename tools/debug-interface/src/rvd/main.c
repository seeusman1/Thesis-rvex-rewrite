        "\n"
        "Almost any integer specification in rvd - addresses, values, contexts, etc. -\n"
        "can be specified using expressions. An expression can be as simple as a number\n"

        "\n"
        "Integer literals\n"
        "----------------\n"
        "The most basic construct in an rvd expression is an integer literal. Literals\n"
        "can be specified like in C, meaning that the following things are all allowed.\n"
        "\n"
        "  <decimal>\n"
        "  0<octal>\n"
        "  0x<hexadecimal>\n"
        "  0b<binary>\n"
        "\n"
        "In addition to that, you can explicitely specify the type you want the literal\n"
        "to be by adding one of the following suffixes to the literal.\n"
        "\n"
        "  w   Word      32 bit\n"
        "  h   Halfword  16 bit\n"
        "  hh  Byte      8 bit\n"
        "\n"
        "The type used for a literal does not affect the ranges allowed. Or rather,\n"
        "there is no range checking anywhere, and everything is an unsigned 32-bit\n"
        "integer internally. However, the type is relevant when performing write\n"
        "operations: calling write(0, 0hh) will write a single byte to address 0,\n"
        "whereas write(0, 0w) will write a word to address 0.\n"
        "\n"
        "When no type is specified anywhere in the evaluation of an expression and type\n"
        "information is needed for evaluation, the type defaults to a word. When multiple\n"
        "explicitely specified types are used in an expression, the widest one is used.\n"
        "So, 1 + 1hh will evaluate to a byte with value 2, whereas 1w + 1hh will evaluate\n"

        "With the exception of the sequential operator, all operators behave the same as\n"
        "their C counterparts (applied to uint32_ts) on their own. However, THERE IS\n"
        "NO OPERATOR PRECEDENCE, and ALL OPERATORS ARE RIGHT ASSOCIATIVE. This means\n"

        "Definitions\n"
        "-----------\n"
        "The definition system is what makes expressions useful. An rvd expression\n"
        "behaves approximately like a C preprocessor definition: when an identifier\n"
        "is encountered in an expression which was previously defined, the defined\n"
        "expansion for the definition is evaluated as if it were an expression. This\n"
        "means that definitions can be used to define constants, as well as functions\n"
        "(without parameters).\n"
        "\n"
        "Definitions can be defined in the following ways.\n"
        "\n"
        " - Through a .map file.\n"
        " - Using the -d or --define command line parameters.\n"
        " - Dynamically within expressions, using the set() or def() functions.\n"
        "\n"
        "The syntax for a definition in a map file or on the command line looks like\n"
        "this:\n"
        "\n"
        "  <contexts>: <name> { <expression> }\n"
        "\n"
        "The <contexts> part specifies for which contexts the definition should be valid.\n"
        "Call \"rvd help select\" for more information; the syntax for <contexts> in the\n"
        "select command parameter is identical.\n"
        "\n"
        "<name> specifies the name for the definition. Names must start with an\n"
        "alphabetical character or an underscore, and may contain any combination of\n"
        "alphanumerical and underscores for the rest of the characters. Names are case\n"
        "sensitive. <expression> may specify any syntactically correct expression.\n"
        "\n"
        "Within .map files, anything between a # (hash) and a newline is a comment.\n"
        "\n"
        "The order in which definitions are defined does not matter, as long as\n"
        "everything is defined when the definition is used in an evaluated expression.\n"
        "This means loops are possible; when a certain number of expansions have been\n"
        "performed, however, parsing will terminate, to prevent hangs in this case.\n"
        "\n"
        "When definitions are defined dynamically using set() or def(), they are bound\n"
        "to the context currently being evaluated. This means that, for all intents and\n"
        "purporses, they behave like variables or dynamically created functions. The\n"
        "difference between set() and def() is that set() evaluates the given expression\n"
        "while set() as part of the set() command (making the definition behave like a\n"
        "variable), whereas def() defers evaluation until the definition is used (like\n"
        "a function).\n"

        "Required definitions\n"
