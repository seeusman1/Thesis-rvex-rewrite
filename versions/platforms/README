The tar archives in this folder represent all the platforms that have been
(attempted to be) synthesized (by you). The archives contain the bit file, source
files of the platform, synthesis logs, etc. The exact contents depend on the
platform that generated it. The filename format is
"<platform-name>-<tag>-<MD5>-core-<core-tag>.tar.gz",
where <tag> and <MD5> represent the platform version tag and <core-tag>
represents the core version tag.

The core version tag is generated in such a way that changes made to the VHDL
source files that don't affect functionality also don't affect the tag. The
platform tag is generated less intelligently; if any source file changes in any
way, the platform tag is also modified.

The purpose of all this is two-fold. First, it provides an automated system
which archives stuff in a platform-independent way. Of course, tags are still a
bit hard to remember, so users may want to set up symlinks to those builds which
they use a lot.

Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, it provides a way to trace a bit file
back to its source. The tag is stored in ROM in the global control registers of
each r-VEX processor, as well as in the debug UART at 0xFFFFFFF9.
