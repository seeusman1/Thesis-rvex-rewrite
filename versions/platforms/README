The subfolders represent all the platforms which have been attempted to be 
synthesized through supporting build systems. The directory format is 
"<tag>-<MD5>", where <tag> and <MD5> are generated by vhdtag (tools directory) 
based on the contents of the "platform-<tag>-<MD5>.tar.gz" file in subfolder. 
Each subfolder also contains a number of timestamped folders which might contain 
stuff like the bit file, synthesis output and logs. This all depends on the 
build system which generates it.

The tags are generated in such a way that changes made to the VHDL source files 
which don't affect functionality also don't affect the tag.

The purpose of all this is two-fold. First, it provides an automated system
which archives stuff in a platform-independent way. Of course, tags are still a
bit hard to remember, so users may want to set up symlinks to those builds which
they use a lot.

Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, it provides a way to trace a bit file
back to its source. The tag is stored in ROM in the global control registers of
each r-VEX processor, as well as in the debug UART at 0xFFFFFFF9.

(at least, it wasn't implemented yet when this was written, but it was the
plan...)
