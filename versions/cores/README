The tar archives in this folder represent all the rvex processor core versions 
that have been (attempted to be) synthesized (by you). The archives contain the 
source files of the core. The filename format is "core-<tag>-<MD5>.tar.gz", 
where <tag> and <MD5> are generated by vhdtag (tools directory).

The tags are generated in such a way that changes to the source files that do
not affect functionality also do not affect the tag.

The reason this is in any way useful is because <tag> is also stored in the core 
itself; it can be read from the global control register file. This would allow 
you to trace a bit file back to its source.
