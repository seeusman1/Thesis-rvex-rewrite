This directory contains configuration files for some key components of the core.
The idea is that these files can be used to generate as many different things as
possible.

Running make will first of all patch source code. Then it will try to regenerate
the PDF documentation, which may fail if you don't have all the required LaTeX
packages installed.

The scripts and templates folders contain the source files needed to generate
everything. The other folders contain the actual configuration files (.tex or
.ini files).
