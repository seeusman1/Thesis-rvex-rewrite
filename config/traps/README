The .tex files in this folder describe the possible trap causes and 
documentation thereof. Because the documentation is in LaTeX, the syntax of 
these files is also LaTeX-like, to be able to use editors with LaTeX syntax 
highlighting.

Files are ordered by their filename alphabetically before being passed to the
interpreter. This order may matter for some commands and, obviously,
documentation.

The following LaTeX-like commands are interpreted by python to define the traps. 
They must be the only thing on a certain line aside from (maybe) comments, 
otherwise they are interpreted as LaTeX documentation.

 - \trap{<index>}{<mnemonic>}{<name>}
   Starts a trap description. <index> is the trap index, which may range from
   1 to 255. <mnemonic> is the trap identifier, which must be a valid C and
   VHDL identifier. It is prefixed with "RVEX_TRAP_" in the definition files.
   <name> is the LaTeX formatted friendly name of the trap, used as the
   section title.

 - \trapgen{<python range>}{<start index>}{<mnemonic>}{<name>}
   Same as \trap, but specifies a list of traps. <python range> is executed as
   a python expression, expected to generate an iterable of integers. A
   trap specification is generated for each of these iterations. The index
   for each trap is computed as <offset> + iter. \n{} expands to the number
   when used inline in <mnemonic>, <name> and <desc> below. In the
   documentation it expands to $n$.

 - \description{<desc>}
   Defines a trap-specific explanation of the trap, to be used by the debug
   systems to allow the user to quickly identify the trap. In this
   description, the following commands may be used inline:
    - \at{}: expands to " at <trap point>" if the trap point is known, or
      nothing if the trap point is not known. The trap point is expressed in
      hexadecimal notation.
    - \arg{u}: expands to the trap argument in unsigned decimal notation.
    - \arg{s}: expands to the trap argument in signed decimal notation.
    - \arg{x}: expands to the trap argument in hexadecimal notation.

 - \debug{}
   Marks that this trap is a debug trap. The {} is required!

 - \interrupt{}
   Marks that this trap is an interrupt trap. The {} is required!
