The .tex files in this folder describe the context and global control registers 
and documentation thereof.Because the documentation is in LaTeX, the syntax of 
these files is also LaTeX-like, to be able to use editors with LaTeX syntax 
highlighting.

Files are ordered by their filename alphabetically before being passed to the
interpreter. This order only matters if a single register is described amongst
multiple files. Documentation is generated based on the addresses.

The following LaTeX-like commands are interpreted by python to define the
control registers. They must be the only thing on a certain line aside from
(maybe) comments, otherwise they are interpreted as LaTeX documentation.

 - \register{<mnemonic>}{<name>}{<offset>}
   Starts a new register description. <name> is the title of the section.
   <mnemonic> is the mnemonic of the register, excluding the CR_. The 
   mnemonic is also used to generate a label using \label{reg:<mnemonic>}.
   <offset> should be a hex number starting with 0x divisible by 4,
   representing the byte offset from the control registers base. Global
   registers should be within the 0x000..0x0FF range, context registers
   should be within 0x200..0x3FF. 0x100..0x1FF is reserved for the general
   purpose register file.

 - \registergen{<python range>}{<mnemonic>}{<name>}{<offset>}{<stride>}
   Same as \register, but specifies a list of registers. <python range> is
   executed as a python expression, expected to generate an iterable of
   integers. A register is generated for each of these iterations. The offset
   for each register is computed as <offset> + iter * <stride>. \n{} expands
   to the number when used inline in <mnemonic> and <name>. In the
   documentation it expands to $n$.

 - \field{<range>}{<mnemonic>}
   Defines a field in the current register. A range specification is either a 
   single bit index for a single-bit field, or of the form <from>..<to>, 
   where  <from> is the higher bit index, and both the <from> and <to> bit 
   are included in the range. <mnemonic> is used in the register graphic, so 
   make it as small as possible if the bitfield is small. It also needs to be
   a valid C and VHDL identifier.

 - \debugCanWrite{}
 - \coreCanWrite{}
   Sets the writable flag for the previously defined field. The {} is
   required!

 - \signed{}
   Marks a field as being signed. The default is unsigned.

 - \reset{<bit vector>}
   Sets the reset state of the previously defined field. If not specified, the
   reset state is assumed to be zero. The number of characters in <bit vector>
   must equal the number of bits in the field.

 - \id{<identifier>}
   Gives a field an alternative name for the C/VHDL/rvd definitions. This only
   works for 8-bit and 16-bit fields that are properly aligned.

 - Anything else:
   Any unrecognized line is used as a description for either the whole 
   register or a field in it.
