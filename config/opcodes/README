The .tex files in this folder describe the instructions encodings of the 
processor and documentation for each instruction. Because the documentation is 
in LaTeX, the syntax of these files is also LaTeX-like, to be able to use 
editors with LaTeX syntax highlighting.

Files are ordered by their filename alphabetically before being passed to the
interpreter. This order may matter for some commands and, obviously,
documentation.

The following LaTeX-like commands are interpreted by python to define the traps. 
They must be the only thing on a certain line aside from (maybe) comments, 
otherwise they are interpreted as LaTeX documentation.

\section{name} - starts a group of instructions in the documentation for
   readability. Any textual lines between \section and \syllable is interpreted
   as LaTeX documentation for the group.

\syllable{opcode}{mnemonic}{syntax} - starts a syllable definition. The opcode
   should be a 9-bit binary string with dashes for don't cares, mapping to
   syllable bit 31..23. The value of the LSB is not really part of the opcode,
   but defines whether the instruction can be used with only a register for
   the second operand (0), only an immediate for the second operand (1), or
   both (-). In VHDL terms, this describes the contents of the "valid" field.
   The mnemonic is the name of the instruction. It will be made lowercase for
   the assembler syntax and uppercase for the documentation (when used without
   context). Finally, the syntax describes the assembler syntax of the
   syllable. In this, the following LaTeX-like commands may be used. The {}
   may be omitted.

   Any textual lines between \syllable and \section or the next \syllable is
   interpreted as LaTeX documentation for the syllable. These text sections
   may also use the commands in the table above inline, but the {} may NOT
   be omitted here.

\class{x} - specifies the resource class. x should be ALU, MEM, MUL, BR or
   LIMMH.

\datapath{member}{value}   - specifies a value for the datapath decoding table.
\alu{member}{value}        - specifies a value for the ALU decoding table.
\branch{member}{value}     - specifies a value for the branch unit decoding table.
\memory{member}{value}     - specifies a value for the memory unit decoding table.
\multiplier{member}{value} - specifies a value for the multiplier decoding table.
   Which members need to be specified and what values they can take depends
   first and foremost the VHDL code (core_opcode*_pkg.vhd). This is also their
   primary documentation source.

\noasm{} - attribute that specifies that this syllable cannot be assembled.
   Used for LIMMH instructions. This will disable rendering the syntax in the
   documentation.

All commands other than \section and \syllable specify attributes for the
syllables. These are used to describe the characteristics and functionality
of the instructions. How they do this depends on where they are written with
respect to the \section and \syllable commands:

 - Attributes specified before the first \section command are interpreted as
   the default. All groups will inherit these attributes.

 - Attributes specified between \section and the first \syllable in the group
   determine the group defaults, overriding the global defaults. All syllables
   within the group will inherit these attributes.
