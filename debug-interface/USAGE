Debug interface for standalone r-VEX processor

The easiest way to start debugging the rvex platform is to use the following
commands.

make server
  Starts the rvsrv daemon if it is not yet running. This needs to be running
  for the other tools to be able to connect.

make stop
  Stops the rvsrv daemon if it is running.

make monitor
  Starts rvcat. rvcat will echo anything sent by the rvex application through
  the UART peripheral (for example using puts or printf) to stdout. Also,
  anything received on stdin will be piped to the UART peripheral.

make debug; source debug
  This will make an alias for rvdbg with the right configuration called rvd,
  so you can quickly and easily send debug commands. Run "rvd help" for a
  command listing.


By default, /dev/ttyS0 is used at 115200 baud. If you need to change this, you
can do so at the top of the makefile. You can also change the TCP ports used
for interprocess communication here.
