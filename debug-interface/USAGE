Debug interface for standalone r-VEX processor

The easiest way to start debugging the rvex platform is to use the following
commands.

make server
  Starts the rvsrv daemon if it is not yet running. This needs to be running
  for the other tools to be able to connect.

make stop
  Stops the rvsrv daemon if it is running.

make catlog
  Dumps the log file generated by rvsrv to the console. The log file is
  /var/tmp/rvsrv.log, by the way.

make monitor
  Runs netcat appropriately to monitor data sent by the rvex application
  through puts, printf and the like (if supported by the compiler environment,
  of course). You can also send newline terminated text to the rvex.

make debug; source debug
  This will allow you to easily send debug commands by just calling
  rvd <command>.


By default, /dev/ttyS0 is used at 115200 baud, and TCP ports 21078 and 21079
are used for the debugging server interface. You can change these settings in
configuration.cfg (in this directory). If it's not there, you can run
make configuration.cfg to get it.
