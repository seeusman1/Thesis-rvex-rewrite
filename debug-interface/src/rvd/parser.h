 * The operators behave the same as in C, but note that there is no operator
 * precedence and all operators are right associative, so spam brackets. The
 * semicolon operator is an exception; it allows two expressions to be executed
 * sequentially. The result of the semicolon operator is the result from the
 * second operand.
 * 
 * The optional "w", "h" and "hh" after an integer literal specify word,
 * halfword or byte access size for writes respectively. For all operators
 * except shifts and the semicolon, the widest access size is used in the
 * result. For shift operators, the resulting access size is that of the
 * first operator.
