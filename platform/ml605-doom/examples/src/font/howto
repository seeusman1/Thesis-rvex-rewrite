To create a new font:
 - In the GIMP, make a new image that's wide enough (2000x100 or something).
 - Use the text tool to draw the following string. Make sure antialiasing is turned OFF.
    ! " # $ % & ' ( ) * + , - . / 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 : ; < = > ? @ A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z [ \ ] ^ _ ` a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z { | } ~
   These characters will be mapped to ASCII 33..126
 - Layer -> discard text information
 - Image -> flatten image
 - Image -> autocrop image
 - At this point, the image must be at most 16 pixels high.
 - File -> export... as PPM to font.ppm (ASCII format)
 - Run make. This will generate the font_*.c files in the src directory.
