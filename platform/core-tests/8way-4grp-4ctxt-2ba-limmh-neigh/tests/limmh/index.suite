-- This test suite contains test cases for LIMMH forwarding. All cases depend
-- on correct behavior for NOP, STOP, STW and ADD instructions, the general
-- purpose register file and forwarding. from-previous-pair-trap.test also
-- depends on RFI, TRAP and in general, sane trap handling.

-- The following test cases test LIMMH behavior when the respective forwarding
-- method is enabled in the CFG vector.
from-neighbor.test
from-previous-pair.test

-- The following test cases test LIMMH behavior when the respective forwarding
-- method is DISABLED in the CFG vector.
from-neighbor-disabled.test
from-previous-pair-disabled.test

-- This test case tests whether the LIMMH instructions from the preceding
-- syllable pair are properly fetched in the case of a branch to the middle of
-- a bundle, which must be possible using RFI.
from-previous-pair-rfi.test

-- This tests the trap which is caused when the destined LIMMH lane isn't using
-- it, which might well point to an invalid forwarding request (or a broken
-- assembler).
limmh-unused.test

-- This tests for a really weird long immediate forwarding bug...
to-branch.test

-- This tests the trap which is caused when two LIMMH syllables try to forward
-- to the same lane.
forwarding-conflict.test
