Debug interface for standalone r-VEX processor

Supported commands:

all:
  Builds the rvsrv, rvd and rvtrace tools.

sudo make server ADDR=<address>:<size>
  Starts the rvsrv daemon if it is not yet running. This needs to be running
  for the other tools to be able to connect. <address> must be set to the AXI
  address of the r-VEX within the PL. You can find this address in Vivado using
  'make zed-configure' on your host machine, in the Address Editor tab. <size>
  must be set to the amount of bytes used for the peripheral, also found in
  that tab.

sudo make server-debug ADDR=<address>:<size>
  Also starts the server, but keeps it running in the foreground as a normal
  program, logging to stdout instead of a file.

make stop
  Stops the rvsrv daemon if it is running.

make catlog
  Dumps the log file generated by rvsrv to the console.

make debug; source debug
  This will allow you to easily send debug commands by just calling
  rvd <command>. rvd is self-documenting.
